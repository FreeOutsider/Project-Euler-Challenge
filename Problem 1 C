I will copy and paste the question here and write my code below.
Question #1:
If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.
Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.

#include<stdio.h>
#include<math.h>

main()
{
  int i;
  int sums;
  sums = 0;

  for(i=0;i<1000;i++)
  {
    if((i%3)==0)
    {
      printf("%d is divisible by 3.\n",i);
      printf("Adding %d.\n",i);
      sums += i;
    }
    else if((i%5)==0)
    {
      printf("%d is divisible by 5.\n",i);
      printf("Adding %d.\n",i);
      sums +=i;
    }
    else
    {
      printf("%d is not divisible by 3 or 5.\n",i);
    }
    printf("The current sum is %d.\n",sums);

    delay(10000);
  }
   puts("The sums of all the numbers that's divisible by 3 or 5 that's smaller than 1000 is");
    printf("%d",sums);

    return 0;
}
